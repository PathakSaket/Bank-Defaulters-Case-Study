# Bank-Defaulters-Case-Study

## Description: 
This case study aims to give us an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, we will develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
 
## Business Understanding:
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter.
Suppose we work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. We have to use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

## Findings:	
Our aim is to identify the patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.  
The driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
Presenting the overall approach of the data analysis, cleaning the dataset, finding outliers, data imbalance, univariate, segmented univariate, bivariate analysis, etc.  
The top 10 correlation for the Client with payment difficulties and all other cases (Target variable).  

## Approach:	
Imported the NumPy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn python libraries.  
Imported the datasets (Application_Data & Previous_Application)   
Identification: We have identified how we will approach the data, finding missing dataset and working on it accordingly to gain the required results.  
Outliers: Identified outliers and showed how they play if any role in our dataset.  
Imbalance: Understanding the ratio of imbalance in our data.   
Correlation Analysis: Finding the correlation between the variables with respect to the target variables and find the top three correlation.  
Visualisation: Visualized the data with the help of charts and graphs.
